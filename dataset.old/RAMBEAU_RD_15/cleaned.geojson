The windows look relatively modern, suggesting they may have been updated to improve energy efficiency. The heating system is electric warm air with air conditioning, likely providing efficient climate control. The full basement could be a source of heat loss if not properly insulated. Overall, the home's exterior and materials suggest it is well-suited for energy conservation, though further inspection of the HVAC system's age and efficiency is recommended.", "Year Built": "1989", "Total Square Feet Living Area": "2,576", "Building Style": "COLONIAL", "Exterior Wall Material": "ALUMINUM/VINYL SIDING", "Heating Fuel Type": "ELECTRIC", "Heating System Type": "WARM AIR", "Heat/Air Cond": "AIR COND", "Bedrooms": "4", "Full Baths": "2", "Half Baths": "1", "Basement": "FULL", "Number of Stories": "2", "Grade": "B - GOOD"}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-75.1652, 40.0052]}}]}
