   ** Warning ** No Timestep object found.  Number of TimeSteps in Hour defaulted to 4.
   ** Warning ** CheckEnvironmentSpecifications: SimulationControl specified doing design day simulations, but no design environments specified.
   **   ~~~   ** ...No design environment results produced. For these results, add appropriate SizingPeriod:* objects for your simulation.
   ** Warning ** Weather file location will be used rather than entered (IDF) Location object.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Location object=TEST LOCATION
   **   ~~~   ** ..Weather File Location=Allentown PA USA TMY--14737 WMO#=725170
   **   ~~~   ** ..due to location differences, Latitude difference=[0.65] degrees, Longitude difference=[0.43] degrees.
   **   ~~~   ** ..Time Zone difference=[0.0] hour(s), Elevation difference=[41.50] percent, [83.00] meters.
   ** Warning ** createSpaceSurfaceLists: Space=TESTZONE has no surfaces.
   ** Warning ** No floor exists in Zone="TESTZONE", zone floor area is zero. All values for this zone that are entered per floor area will be zero.
   ** Warning ** Indicated Zone Volume <= 0.0 for Zone=TESTZONE
   **   ~~~   ** The calculated Zone Volume was=0.00
   **   ~~~   ** The simulation will continue with the Zone Volume set to 10.0 m3. 
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual zones.
   ** Severe  ** InitSolarViewFactors: No surfaces in enclosure=TESTZONE.
   ** Warning ** Surfaces in Zone/Enclosure="TESTZONE" do not define an enclosure.
   **   ~~~   ** Number of surfaces <= 3, view factors are set to force reciprocity but may not fulfill completeness.
   **   ~~~   ** Reciprocity means that radiant exchange between two surfaces will match and not lead to an energy loss.
   **   ~~~   ** Completeness means that all of the view factors between a surface and the other surfaces in a zone add up to unity.
   **   ~~~   ** So, when there are three or less surfaces in a zone, EnergyPlus will make sure there are no losses of energy but
   **   ~~~   ** it will not exchange the full amount of radiation with the rest of the zone as it would if there was a completed enclosure.
   **  Fatal  ** InitSolarViewFactors: Errors found during initialization of diffuse solar distribution.  Program terminated.
   ...Summary of Errors that led to program termination:
   ..... Reference severe error count=1
   ..... Last severe error=InitSolarViewFactors: No surfaces in enclosure=TESTZONE.
