The windows look relatively modern, suggesting they may have been updated to improve energy efficiency. The heating system is electric warm air with air conditioning, likely providing efficient climate control. The full basement could be a source of heat loss if not properly insulated. Overall, the home's exterior and materials suggest it is well-suited for energy conservation, though further inspection of the HVAC system's age and efficiency is recommended.", "weather": "KABE"}
