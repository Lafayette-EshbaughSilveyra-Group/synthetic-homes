The aluminum/vinyl siding is in average condition, providing moderate insulation. Windows seem older, and upgrading to double-pane could improve energy efficiency. The electric heating system is functional, though considering its age, a modern heat pump might reduce energy costs. The central air conditioning is a plus for comfort. The full basement offers potential for added insulation. Overall, the property shows good potential for energy upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
