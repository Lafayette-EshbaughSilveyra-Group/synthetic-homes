        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1976, appears well-maintained. The aluminum/vinyl siding is in average condition, providing moderate insulation. Windows seem older, and upgrading to double-pane could improve energy efficiency. The electric heating system is functional, though considering its age, a modern heat pump might reduce energy costs. The central air conditioning is a plus for comfort. The full basement offers potential for added insulation. Overall, the property shows good potential for energy upgrades.",
