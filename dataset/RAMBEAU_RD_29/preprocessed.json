The bi-level structure is equipped with a warm air electric heating system and air conditioning, indicating moderate energy efficiency. The HVAC system appears functional but may benefit from an upgrade for improved efficiency. Windows seem original, suggesting potential heat loss issues; replacement might enhance insulation. The full basement offers additional living space but should be checked for insulation to prevent energy loss. Overall, the property appears well-maintained with potential for energy upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
