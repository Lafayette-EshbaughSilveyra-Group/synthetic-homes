The windows seem original and might benefit from upgrading to improve energy efficiency. The warm air heating system is electric, and the presence of air conditioning is a plus for comfort. Given the age, insulation in the walls and attic could be improved unless previously upgraded. The full basement might offer additional insulation challenges but also potential for energy efficiency improvements. There are no visible signs of recent upgrades to HVAC or windows from the exterior.", "weather": "KABE"}
