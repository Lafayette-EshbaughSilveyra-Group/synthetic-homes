The windows seem to be double-paned, which is good for insulation, although they might benefit from weatherstripping updates. The electric warm air heating system and air conditioning indicate potentially higher efficiency if maintained well. No major upgrades visible, but overall the structure seems well-kept for its age. Consider checking the attic for any additional insulation opportunities, as there is no mention of an attic space.", "weather": "KABE"}
