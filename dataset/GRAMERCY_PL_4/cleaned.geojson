        "inspection_note": "The Colonial-style home built in 1993 shows good energy efficiency characteristics. The aluminum/vinyl siding appears well-maintained. The HVAC system is electric with air conditioning, a typical setup for homes of this age. The oil heating suggests a need for regular maintenance. Windows look standard for the period, likely double-pane but could benefit from sealing improvements. No visible signs of recent upgrades; consider assessing the attic insulation despite no attic space, focusing on improving energy retention.",
