The windows seem to be double-pane, which should help in reducing energy loss. The heating system is an electric heat pump, likely efficient but could be evaluated for any upgrades if over 20 years old. The presence of central air conditioning is a plus. Overall, the home maintains a good energy efficiency standard for its age.", "weather": "KABE"}
