        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1968, exhibits average insulation typical of its era. The aluminum/vinyl siding is in fair condition but may benefit from sealing to improve energy efficiency. The HVAC system is electric warm air with air conditioning, indicating potential moderate energy costs, depending on the system's maintenance. Windows appear to be single-pane and may not provide optimal insulation, suggesting an upgrade could substantially reduce energy loss. The full basement offers additional living space but should be checked for proper insulation to avoid heat loss. Overall, the property is in good condition, but energy efficiency could be enhanced with targeted upgrades.",
