The windows seem to be in average condition with no visible upgrades, suggesting potential heat loss areas. The electric warm air heating system is typical for homes built in the 1980s. No visible signs of recent upgrades or significant insulation enhancements. Overall, the home likely performs adequately for energy efficiency given its age and construction.",
