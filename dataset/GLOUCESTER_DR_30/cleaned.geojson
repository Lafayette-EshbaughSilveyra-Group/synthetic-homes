The HVAC system is electric and includes warm air heating and air conditioning. The windows seem to be original, suggesting potential energy inefficiency. No significant insulation upgrades are visible. The full basement may benefit from additional insulation to improve energy efficiency. Overall, the home is in good condition with some opportunities for energy improvements.",
