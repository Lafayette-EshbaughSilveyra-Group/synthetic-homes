        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1987, appears to have good energy efficiency features for its age. The aluminum/vinyl siding likely provides moderate insulation. The windows seem to be double-pane, which helps in reducing heat loss. The HVAC system is electric with warm air heating, probably requiring an update to improve efficiency. The presence of central air conditioning is a plus for energy management. No visible signs of recent energy-efficient upgrades but overall in good condition.",
