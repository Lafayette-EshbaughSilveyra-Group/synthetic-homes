The electric warm air heating system is complemented by central air conditioning. Windows seem original and may benefit from upgrading for better insulation. The full basement could be evaluated for additional insulation opportunities. Overall, the home has a solid structure with potential for energy efficiency improvements, particularly in window quality and attic insulation.", "weather": "KABE"}
