        "inspection_note": "The home built in 1990 appears to have aluminum/vinyl siding, which is generally durable but should be checked for any signs of wear. The windows seem to be double-paned, which is good for insulation, though their age might affect efficiency. The electric warm air heating system likely provides adequate heat, but its age should be assessed to ensure efficiency. The presence of air conditioning is a positive factor for comfort. No visible upgrades to insulation or HVAC systems are apparent from the exterior, so checking the interior would be advisable. Overall, the property is in average condition with potential for energy efficiency improvements.",
