The HVAC system is electric warm air, likely requiring an update if original. Windows appear double-glazed, which is beneficial for insulation. The full basement provides additional space but should be checked for insulation quality. Overall, the house seems to be well-maintained with potential for energy efficiency improvements in the HVAC system.", "weather": "KABE"}
