The heat pump system and electric heating fuel are consistent with energy-efficient practices for the period, but the age of the system may warrant future upgrades. The windows appear original; upgrading to double-pane models could improve insulation. The full basement offers potential for increased energy efficiency if properly insulated. Overall, the home seems well-maintained but could benefit from modern insulation improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
