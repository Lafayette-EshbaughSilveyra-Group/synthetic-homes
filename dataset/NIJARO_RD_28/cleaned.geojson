The heating system is electric warm air, typical for the period, likely requiring evaluation for efficiency. Windows seem older and may benefit from upgrades to enhance insulation. The home has a full basement and normal heating and air conditioning, indicating standard insulation levels for its time. No recent upgrades are visible, suggesting potential improvements in energy efficiency could be explored.",
