The windows look original, likely double-pane, which may benefit from upgrades to improve energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system suggests moderate efficiency; checking the age of the HVAC unit is recommended to assess potential upgrades. Central air conditioning is present, enhancing comfort. The full basement could be a source of heat loss if not properly insulated.",
