The split-level design and full basement offer potential areas for heat loss if not properly insulated. The electric hot water heating system is typical but may benefit from an upgrade to improve efficiency. Windows look original and may not be double-glazed, which could lead to energy inefficiency. Overall, the house seems to be in average condition, but upgrading to modern HVAC systems and improving window insulation could enhance energy efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
