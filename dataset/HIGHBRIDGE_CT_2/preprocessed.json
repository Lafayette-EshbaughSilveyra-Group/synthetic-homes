The windows seem original and may lack modern energy efficiency features. The heating system is warm air, but the fuel type is unknown, which could impact energy efficiency. The presence of air conditioning is a positive feature. Insulation status is unclear; potential upgrades could enhance energy savings. Consider assessing HVAC for age and efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
