The electric warm air heating system appears standard but may benefit from an upgrade to a more efficient model, considering potential age. Windows look like original installations; upgrading to double-pane energy-efficient windows could improve insulation. No significant energy efficiency upgrades are visible. The attic has no additional insulation, which could be another area for improvement to enhance energy retention.",
