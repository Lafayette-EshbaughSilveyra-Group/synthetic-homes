        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1977, features aluminum/vinyl siding which appears to be in average condition. The windows seem original, likely single-pane, which may impact energy efficiency. The electric heating system is warm air, suggesting moderate efficiency, but the presence of air conditioning is a plus for comfort. The basement is full and finished, which may benefit from additional insulation to improve thermal performance. Overall, the property is well-maintained, though upgrading the windows and adding modern insulation could enhance energy efficiency.",
