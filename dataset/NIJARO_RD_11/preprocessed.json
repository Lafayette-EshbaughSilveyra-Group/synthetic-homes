The electric hot water heating system paired with air conditioning suggests moderate energy efficiency but may benefit from upgrades. Windows look original and might lack modern insulating features. The full basement could be inspected for insulation improvements to enhance energy retention. Overall, the home is in average condition with potential for energy efficiency improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
