The heating system is electric warm air, and there is central air conditioning. The windows, typical of the 1980s era, may lack modern energy efficiency but seem well-maintained. Insulation quality likely meets standards from the time of construction, though upgrading could improve energy efficiency. The full basement might benefit from additional insulation. Overall, the property seems well-kept with potential for energy upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
