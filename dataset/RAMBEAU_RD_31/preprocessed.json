The electric warm air heating system is standard for the era and may benefit from an upgrade to improve efficiency. The windows show signs of age, possibly affecting insulation and energy retention. No visible insulation upgrades are present. The full basement may contribute to heat retention if properly insulated. Overall, the house seems well-maintained but could benefit from modern energy efficiency updates.", "weather": "KABE"}
