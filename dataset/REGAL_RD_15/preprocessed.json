The full basement suggests potential for added living area if finished. The electric warm air heating system is paired with air conditioning, suitable for year-round comfort, though the efficiency could be improved with modern upgrades. Windows seem original, indicating potential heat loss; replacing them with double-glazed units could enhance insulation. Overall, the property is well-maintained, but updating the HVAC system and improving window insulation would likely increase energy efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
