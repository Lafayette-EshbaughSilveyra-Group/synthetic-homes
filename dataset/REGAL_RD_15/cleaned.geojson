        "inspection_note": "The Colonial style home, built in 1989, features aluminum/vinyl siding which appears in average condition. The full basement suggests potential for added living area if finished. The electric warm air heating system is paired with air conditioning, suitable for year-round comfort, though the efficiency could be improved with modern upgrades. Windows seem original, indicating potential heat loss; replacing them with double-glazed units could enhance insulation. Overall, the property is well-maintained, but updating the HVAC system and improving window insulation would likely increase energy efficiency.",
