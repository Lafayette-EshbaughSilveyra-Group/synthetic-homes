The HVAC system is electric warm air with air conditioning, suggesting moderate efficiency typical for its age. The windows appear original; upgrading to double-pane could improve energy efficiency. The full basement could be better insulated for enhanced energy savings. Overall, the property is in good condition, but energy improvements could be considered.",
