The windows seem original and might benefit from upgrading to enhance energy efficiency. The HVAC system is electric with warm air heating, which is efficient but could be costly; consider evaluating its age and efficiency. The presence of air conditioning is beneficial, though checking its age and system maintenance is recommended. No obvious energy-efficient upgrades are visible, suggesting a potential for improvement in insulation and window quality.", "weather": "KABE"}
