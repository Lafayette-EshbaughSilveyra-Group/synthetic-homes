        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1987, appears to be well-maintained with aluminum/vinyl siding providing decent insulation. The windows seem original and might benefit from upgrading to enhance energy efficiency. The HVAC system is electric with warm air heating, which is efficient but could be costly; consider evaluating its age and efficiency. The presence of air conditioning is beneficial, though checking its age and system maintenance is recommended. No obvious energy-efficient upgrades are visible, suggesting a potential for improvement in insulation and window quality.",
