The HVAC system is electric and uses a warm air delivery method, with air conditioning noted. Windows are double-hung, likely original, suggesting potential for energy efficiency improvements. The home lacks attic insulation, which could be an area for upgrade to enhance thermal performance. No recent upgrades to insulation or HVAC are evident, but the overall condition is good.",
