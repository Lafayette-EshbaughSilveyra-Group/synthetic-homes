The heating system is electric warm air, which may benefit from an upgrade for improved efficiency. Windows seem original, suggesting potential heat loss; upgrading to double-pane could improve energy efficiency. The insulation status is unclear, but given the age, it might not meet modern standards. Consider inspecting the attic and walls for potential improvements. The HVAC system seems standard for its type and age, however, a check on its efficiency could be beneficial.", "weather": "KABE"}
