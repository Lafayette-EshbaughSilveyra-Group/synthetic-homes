The HVAC system is a heat pump with electric fuel, suggesting moderate energy efficiency. The full basement is likely to provide additional insulation, though it should be checked for any moisture issues. Windows appear to be double-pane, which should offer good insulation. No visible signs of recent upgrades, but the exterior condition is excellent. Recommend checking the age and service history of the HVAC system for optimal performance.", "weather": "KABE"}
