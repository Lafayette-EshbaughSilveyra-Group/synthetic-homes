The windows seem to be original and may benefit from upgrading to improve energy efficiency. The HVAC system is a warm air type powered by electricity, and given the age, an assessment of its condition and efficiency is recommended. The attic insulation is likely minimal as indicated by the absence of an attic space. The home includes a full basement which could contribute to heat loss if not properly insulated. Overall, the property presents opportunities for energy efficiency improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
