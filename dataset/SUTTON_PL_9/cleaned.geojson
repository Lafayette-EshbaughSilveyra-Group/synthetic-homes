The heat pump system, paired with electric heating, suggests moderate efficiency, typical for its age. Windows are double-hung, likely original, and may benefit from upgrading to improve insulation. The full basement provides additional space, though insulation status is unknown. Overall, the home is well-maintained with potential energy efficiency improvements in window and HVAC upgrades.",
