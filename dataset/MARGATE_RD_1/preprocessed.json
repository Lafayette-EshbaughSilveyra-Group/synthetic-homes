The electric warm air heating system appears to be standard for its time, but may benefit from an upgrade for better efficiency. The windows seem to be original and could be improved for better insulation. The roof is in average condition, and there is a full basement which might provide additional space for insulation improvements. Overall, the structure is in good condition, but some energy efficiency upgrades could enhance comfort and reduce utility costs.", "weather": "KABE"}
