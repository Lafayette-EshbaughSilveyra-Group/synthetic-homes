The electric warm air heating system is standard for homes of this age, though upgrading to a more efficient system could reduce energy costs. Windows are older but seem to be double-pane, which helps with insulation. The attic is not present, which might limit insulation efficiency. Consider checking the basement for potential insulation improvements to enhance energy efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
