        "inspection_note": "This Colonial-style home, built in 1900, shows its historic character. The stucco exterior appears well-maintained. The home is equipped with an electric warm air heating system, and central air conditioning is present, suggesting some modern updates. Given the age, insulation effectiveness might vary, especially in the attic and basement areas. Windows seem to be older, potentially single-pane, which could benefit from upgrades to improve energy efficiency. Overall, the home's energy features are reasonable, but enhancements could further optimize efficiency.",
