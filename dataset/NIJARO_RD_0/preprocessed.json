The windows seem to be double-pane, enhancing energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system and air conditioning are likely original, given the house was built in 1988. No major upgrades are visible, suggesting the HVAC system may need evaluation for efficiency improvements. The full basement is an opportunity for additional insulation to improve energy conservation.", "weather": "KABE"}
