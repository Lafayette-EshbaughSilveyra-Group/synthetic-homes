The windows seem original and could potentially benefit from upgrading to improve insulation and energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system, combined with air conditioning, suggests modern HVAC amenities. The basement is fully finished, likely providing additional living space. Overall, the property is well-maintained but may benefit from updated insulation and window replacements to enhance energy efficiency.",
