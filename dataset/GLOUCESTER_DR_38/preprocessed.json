The HVAC system is electric warm air with air conditioning, likely original but maintained. Windows are double paned, suggesting decent insulation, though some may benefit from sealing improvements. The full basement is typical for the area and may offer additional insulation opportunities. Overall, the property is well-maintained with potential for energy efficiency upgrades, particularly in attic insulation as it currently lacks any.", "weather": "KABE"}
