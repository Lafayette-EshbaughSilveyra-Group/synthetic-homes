The windows appear double-glazed, which should help in maintaining energy efficiency. The heating system is gas-powered warm air, and the presence of air conditioning suggests a complete HVAC system. While the system might still be functional, considering its age, an evaluation for potential upgrades could enhance efficiency. The full basement could offer additional insulation benefits, though it should be checked for moisture issues. Overall, the property seems well-maintained with no visible signs of significant wear or energy inefficiencies from the exterior.", "weather": "KABE"}
