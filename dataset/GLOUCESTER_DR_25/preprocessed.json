The aluminum/vinyl siding is in average condition, potentially providing moderate insulation. The HVAC system is electric with warm air distribution, which may benefit from an efficiency upgrade if original. Windows are double-pane and seem well-sealed, though checking for drafts could be beneficial. No recent upgrades are visible, but the structure suggests a solid energy performance typical of its era.", "weather": "KABE"}
