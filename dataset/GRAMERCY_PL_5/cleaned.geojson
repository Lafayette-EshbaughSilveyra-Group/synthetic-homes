The electric warm air heating system is paired with air conditioning, suggesting a well-maintained HVAC system. The windows seem relatively modern, likely double-glazed, aiding in energy efficiency. The full basement is a plus for insulation, though further inspection of its sealing is recommended. Overall, the property reflects a colonial style with good energy efficiency features for its age.",
