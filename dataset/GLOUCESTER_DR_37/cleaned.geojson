        "inspection_note": "The home appears well-maintained with aluminum/vinyl siding which provides decent insulation. The windows look modern, likely double-pane, aiding in energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system is complemented by air conditioning, suggesting a focus on year-round comfort. The roof and exterior seem to be in good condition, typical for a property built in 1990. The full basement could potentially offer additional insulated space. No immediate energy efficiency upgrades are evident, but the overall condition is very good.",
