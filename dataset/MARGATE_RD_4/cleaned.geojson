The windows seem to be in good condition, likely double-paned, which helps improve energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system is standard for a home of this age, though upgrading to a modern HVAC system might improve efficiency. No basement is present, which can reduce heat loss. Overall, the home is in average condition with potential for energy upgrades.",
