The windows seem to be original, likely double-pane, but checking for drafts would be advisable. The HVAC system is electric with warm air, supported by air conditioning, suggesting a modern setup from the 1990s. No visible signs of major upgrades, but the overall condition is good for its age. Consider an insulation upgrade in the attic to improve energy efficiency further.", "weather": "KABE"}
