The gas hot water heating system is efficient, though its age should be checked for potential upgrades. Air conditioning is present and likely integrated with the heating system. Windows appear original; updating them could improve energy efficiency. The full basement might benefit from additional insulation if unfinished. Overall, the home is in good condition with a solid energy performance, but window and HVAC upgrades could enhance efficiency.",
