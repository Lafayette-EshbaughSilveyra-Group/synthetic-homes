The split-level design offers a full basement which may contribute to better insulation. The electric warm air heating system is complemented by air conditioning, but the age of the HVAC system should be evaluated for efficiency. Windows seem standard for the build year; consider checking seals for drafts. Overall, the energy efficiency is typical for its era, with potential improvements in insulation and modern window upgrades.",
