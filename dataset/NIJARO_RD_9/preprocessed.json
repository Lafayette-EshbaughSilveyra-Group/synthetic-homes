The windows appear to be original and may benefit from upgrades to improve energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system, along with central air conditioning, is typical for homes of this age. Insulation levels could not be assessed externally, but given the year built, they may meet the standards of the time. No significant upgrades to the exterior are visible from this inspection.", "weather": "KABE"}
