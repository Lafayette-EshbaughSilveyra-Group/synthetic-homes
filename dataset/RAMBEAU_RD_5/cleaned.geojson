The HVAC system is electric with warm air heating, possibly original but functioning due to the good condition noted. Windows seem to be double-paned, which is typical for homes of this age, aiding in energy efficiency. No recent upgrades are visibly apparent, but the overall state suggests proper upkeep. The presence of central air conditioning adds to the home's comfort.",
