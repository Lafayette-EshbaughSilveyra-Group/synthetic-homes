The exterior features aluminum/vinyl siding, which appears to be in average condition. The home is equipped with an electric heat pump and central air conditioning, suitable for efficient climate control. Windows appear original and may benefit from upgrading to double-pane for improved insulation. The full basement could offer additional living space but wasn't visibly inspected.
