        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1986, features aluminum/vinyl siding which appears to be in average condition. The HVAC system is electric, utilizing a warm air system, likely indicating moderate efficiency. The presence of air conditioning suggests comfort in warmer months, though the system's age might affect energy efficiency. Windows appear standard for the era, potentially lacking modern insulation benefits. The property is a two-story colonial with a full basement, offering potential for energy upgrades such as improved insulation and newer window installations.",
