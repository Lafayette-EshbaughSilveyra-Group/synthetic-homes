The warm air heating system uses electric fuel, typical for homes of this age. Windows seem to be original to the house and may benefit from upgrading to more energy-efficient models. The presence of a full basement offers potential for improved insulation. No significant upgrades or issues were noticeable other than the general aging of materials.", "weather": "KABE"}
