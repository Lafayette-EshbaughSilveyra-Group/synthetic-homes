The heating system is electric warm air with air conditioning, suggesting a focus on energy efficiency, though the system's age should be verified for optimal performance. Windows look original; upgrading to double-pane could improve energy retention. The colonial style home with a full basement and two stories is in good condition, but ensuring proper insulation in the attic and basement areas would enhance energy savings.", "weather": "KABE"}
