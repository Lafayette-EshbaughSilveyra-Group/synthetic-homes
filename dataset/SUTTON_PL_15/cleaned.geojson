The HVAC system is warm air with air conditioning, though the heating fuel type is unspecified, suggesting potential for an upgrade to a more efficient system. The windows seem to be original, likely single-pane, which may benefit from modern replacements to improve insulation. The overall condition is good, with potential enhancements in window insulation and heating efficiency.",
