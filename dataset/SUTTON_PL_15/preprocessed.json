The exterior brick walls appear sturdy and well-maintained. The HVAC system is warm air with air conditioning, though the heating fuel type is unspecified, suggesting potential for an upgrade to a more efficient system. The windows seem to be original, likely single-pane, which may benefit from modern replacements to improve insulation.
