The HVAC system utilizes electric warm air, and the presence of air conditioning is noted. Insulation quality is not directly visible, but the exterior suggests it may be adequate for its age. Windows appear original, and upgrading them could improve energy efficiency. The full basement provides additional space but should be evaluated for insulation and potential moisture issues.",
