The windows seem original, suggesting potential improvements in insulation could enhance energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system is functional, though upgrading to a more modern system may offer better efficiency. The presence of air conditioning is beneficial for summer months. No obvious upgrades to insulation are visible, indicating potential for energy-saving improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
