Air conditioning is present, which is a plus for comfort. Windows look original, possibly single-pane, suggesting potential for energy efficiency improvements. No visible signs of recent upgrades to insulation or HVAC. Overall, the home is in good condition but could benefit from modern energy efficiency updates.",
