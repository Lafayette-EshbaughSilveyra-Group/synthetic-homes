The gas warm air heating system is likely original but has been fitted with air conditioning, indicating some updates for efficiency. The windows are traditional, suggesting potential for energy loss if not upgraded. Insulation specifics are not visible, but given the age, an upgrade might improve performance. The colonial style and very good grade imply quality construction.",
