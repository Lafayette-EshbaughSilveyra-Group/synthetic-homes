The HVAC system is a warm air system using electric fuel, which is typical for homes of this era. The presence of air conditioning is a positive aspect for energy efficiency. Windows appear to be original double-pane, which may benefit from an upgrade to improve insulation. The full basement provides potential for additional insulation improvements to enhance energy efficiency. Overall, the property seems well-maintained with no visible major issues, but some upgrades to windows and insulation could enhance energy efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
