The windows seem to be in average condition, suggesting they may be original and could benefit from upgrading to improve energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system is typical for the time period, but the efficiency might be improved with modern insulation and sealing. The exterior walls and attic lack visible insulation, which might be an area for energy efficiency improvements. Overall, the property is in good condition with potential for energy-saving upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
