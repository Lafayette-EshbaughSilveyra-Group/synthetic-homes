        "inspection_note": "The home appears well-maintained with aluminum/vinyl siding, offering decent insulation. The windows seem to be original, likely single-pane, which may impact energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system, complemented by central air conditioning, seems functional but could benefit from an upgrade for improved efficiency. The roof appears in good condition, suggesting recent maintenance. Overall, the property is in good shape, but updating windows and considering additional insulation could enhance energy efficiency.",
