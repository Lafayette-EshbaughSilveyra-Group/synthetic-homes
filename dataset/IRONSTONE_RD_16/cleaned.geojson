        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1972, features aluminum/vinyl siding which appears to be in average condition. The windows look older and may benefit from upgrades to improve insulation and energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system is typical for the era, but consider evaluating its efficiency to see if an upgrade is warranted. No attic insulation is visible, which could be a point of energy loss. The full basement may provide additional space for insulation improvements. Overall, the home seems well-maintained but could benefit from modern energy upgrades.",
