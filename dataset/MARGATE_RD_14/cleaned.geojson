The exterior is framed, which might benefit from additional insulation to improve energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system is functional, yet checking for any recent upgrades would be beneficial. Air conditioning is present, likely adding to comfort during warmer months. Windows seem original and may not be double-glazed, potentially affecting thermal efficiency. Overall, the structure shows potential for minor improvements to enhance energy savings.",
