        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1992, appears to have well-maintained aluminum/vinyl siding, which is beneficial for insulation. The windows seem to be double-pane and in good condition, providing effective thermal resistance. The electric heating system is a warm air type, likely efficient given the era and style. The presence of central air conditioning suggests good climate control. Overall, the energy efficiency appears to be above average for a home of this age and type, though checking the age of the HVAC system could reveal opportunities for upgrades.",
