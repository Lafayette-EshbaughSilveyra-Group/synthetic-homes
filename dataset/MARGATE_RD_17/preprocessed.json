The double-pane windows seem relatively modern, offering good insulation. The electric warm air heating system is likely efficient for its age, but regular maintenance would be beneficial. The presence of air conditioning is a plus for energy efficiency. Overall, the home is in good condition with potential for energy efficiency improvements in insulation and HVAC upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
