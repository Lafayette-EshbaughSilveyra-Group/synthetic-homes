The heating system is warm air, but the fuel type is unknown, which may impact energy efficiency. The presence of air conditioning is a positive feature. Windows appear dated, which may lead to energy loss. The full basement could provide additional insulation if properly maintained. Overall, the property's energy efficiency could benefit from window upgrades and a review of the heating system's fuel source.", "weather": "KABE"}
