The electric warm air heating system appears to be in good condition, but its efficiency will depend on its age and maintenance history. Central air conditioning is present, offering modern climate control. Windows are double-hung and seem to be in good condition, likely providing adequate insulation. No obvious signs of energy-efficient upgrades such as solar panels or advanced insulation materials are visible. Overall, the property is in good condition but could benefit from a review of the HVAC system's efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
