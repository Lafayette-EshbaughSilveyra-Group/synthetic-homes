The HVAC system is electric with warm air heating and air conditioning, suggesting moderate energy efficiency. Windows look original and may benefit from upgrades to double glazing for better insulation. The full basement could be checked for insulation improvements. Overall, the property is well-maintained with potential for energy efficiency upgrades in window and insulation quality.",
