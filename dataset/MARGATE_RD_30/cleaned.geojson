        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1994, features aluminum/vinyl siding which is generally low-maintenance. The heat pump system, paired with electric heating, suggests that it could benefit from upgrades for better energy efficiency, especially if the system is original. The windows appear to be double-pane, which is good for insulation, but inspecting the seals for drafts would be advisable. The presence of central air conditioning is a positive feature for comfort. Overall, the house seems well-maintained, but checking for additional insulation in the attic and walls could contribute to further energy savings.",
