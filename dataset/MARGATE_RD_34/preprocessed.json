The warm air heating system is electric and equipped with air conditioning, which may affect energy efficiency depending on the system's age. Windows seem to be double-pane, offering decent insulation but should be checked for drafts. The absence of attic insulation could impact heating costs. Overall, the structure is well-maintained, with potential for energy efficiency improvements in heating and window sealing.", "weather": "KABE"}
