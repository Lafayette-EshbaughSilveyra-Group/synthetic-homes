The windows look original and may benefit from upgrading to improve insulation. The HVAC system is electric with warm air distribution and includes air conditioning, which suggests a moderate level of energy efficiency. No visible signs of recent upgrades, so consider checking the insulation quality in the attic and walls. Overall, the property is in good condition, but energy efficiency improvements could focus on window upgrades and possibly additional insulation.", "weather": "KABE"}
