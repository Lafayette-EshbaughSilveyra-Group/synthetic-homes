        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1975, appears well-maintained with aluminum/vinyl siding, which provides decent insulation. The windows seem to be original, suggesting potential heat loss. The electric warm air heating system is likely efficient, but its age could reduce performance. The presence of air conditioning indicates good temperature control. No visible upgrades to the HVAC system are noted; an energy audit could recommend improvements.",
