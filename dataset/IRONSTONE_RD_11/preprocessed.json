The heating system is an electric warm air type, likely original or older, suggesting potential efficiency improvements. Insulation appears standard for the era, with some visible signs of wear. Windows look original and may benefit from upgrades to improve energy efficiency. The absence of attic space could limit insulation options. Overall, the home's energy systems are functional but could benefit from modern upgrades for improved efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
