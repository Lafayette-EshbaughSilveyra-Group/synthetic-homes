The HVAC system is electric with hot water heating, indicating potential for efficiency improvements with newer technologies. The air conditioning is present, which is beneficial for summer months. Windows appear standard for the build year; upgrading to double-pane windows could enhance insulation. The full basement offers opportunities for additional insulation to reduce heat loss. Overall, the property is in good condition with room for energy efficiency upgrades.",
