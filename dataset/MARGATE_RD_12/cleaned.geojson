        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1983, features a colonial style with aluminum/vinyl siding, which appears to be in average condition. The insulation level may need assessing, as homes from this era often lack modern standards of insulation. The HVAC system is electric warm air and includes air conditioning, potentially indicating a system update. Windows appear original; upgrading to double-pane could improve energy efficiency. No visible major upgrades, but the overall maintenance suggests a well-preserved property.",
