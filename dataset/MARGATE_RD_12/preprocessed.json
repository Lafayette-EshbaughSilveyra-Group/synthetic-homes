The insulation level may need assessing, as homes from this era often lack modern standards of insulation. The HVAC system is electric warm air and includes air conditioning, potentially indicating a system update. Windows appear original; upgrading to double-pane could improve energy efficiency. No visible major upgrades, but the overall maintenance suggests a well-preserved property.", "weather": "KABE"}
