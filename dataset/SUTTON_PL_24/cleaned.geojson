        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1973, shows its age in some features but has been well-maintained. The aluminum/vinyl siding provides decent insulation, though additional measures might improve energy efficiency. The windows appear original and could benefit from upgrades to double-pane for better thermal performance. The gas warm air heating system is standard for the age, but inspecting the HVAC system for efficiency upgrades is advisable. The presence of air conditioning is a plus for summer months. Overall, the property has good potential for energy efficiency improvements with targeted updates.",
