The heating system is electric warm air, likely older, suggesting an HVAC upgrade could improve efficiency. Windows seem original; replacing them with modern, double-glazed units would enhance insulation. The full basement offers potential for added efficiency improvements. Overall, the home is well-maintained but could see energy savings with targeted upgrades.",
