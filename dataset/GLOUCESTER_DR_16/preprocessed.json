The electric warm air heating system appears to be original, suggesting it may lack modern efficiency. The air conditioning is present, enhancing comfort. Windows appear older and might benefit from upgrading to improve energy efficiency. The full basement is likely uninsulated, which could be a source of heat loss. Overall, the property is well-maintained but would benefit from updates to improve energy efficiency, particularly in HVAC and window systems.", "weather": "KABE"}
