The windows seem to be older and may benefit from upgrading to double-pane for better insulation. The electric warm air heating system is typical for its age, and ensuring regular maintenance could improve efficiency. The full basement offers potential for added insulation. Overall, the house could benefit from minor energy efficiency upgrades, including improved window glazing and attic insulation enhancement.",
