The electric warm air heating system is complemented by central air conditioning. Windows seem to be original but in good condition, potentially double-pane for improved insulation. The full basement may offer additional storage or utility space. No visible signs of recent upgrades or major energy efficiency issues from the exterior.", "weather": "KABE"}
