The electric warm air heating system appears to be functional, though its age should be checked for efficiency. The air conditioning system is present but may benefit from a service check to ensure optimal performance. Windows appear to be original; upgrading to double-pane could improve insulation. The full basement is a potential area for adding insulation to enhance energy efficiency.",
