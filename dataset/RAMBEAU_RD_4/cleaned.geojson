The windows seem to be in good condition, likely original but well-kept, providing moderate insulation. The HVAC system is a warm air, electric type, which suggests moderate energy efficiency for a home built in 1987. No visible signs of recent upgrades to insulation or energy systems. The full basement provides potential for more insulation improvements. Overall, the home is in very good condition with potential for energy efficiency updates.",
