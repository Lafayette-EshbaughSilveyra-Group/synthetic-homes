        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1991, is a two-story colonial style with aluminum/vinyl siding, indicating moderate insulation capabilities. The electric warm air heating system appears to be original, suggesting it may be nearing the end of its efficient lifespan. The air conditioning system is present, but its age could affect efficiency. Windows are double-hung and likely original, which may benefit from upgrading to newer, more energy-efficient models. No recent upgrades to insulation or HVAC systems are visible, but the home is generally in good condition with a full basement that could be further insulated to improve energy efficiency.",
