        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1988, features aluminum/vinyl siding which appears to be in average condition. The windows look to be original and may benefit from upgrades to improve insulation efficiency. The electric warm air heating system, combined with air conditioning, suggests moderate energy use, though verifying the system's age and maintenance records would be beneficial. The property has a full basement which provides potential for additional insulation improvements. Overall, the energy efficiency is typical for its age, but potential upgrades could enhance performance.",
