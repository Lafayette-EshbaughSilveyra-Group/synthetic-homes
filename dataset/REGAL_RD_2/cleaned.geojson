        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1991, appears to be in excellent condition with a full basement and a colonial style. The exterior is aluminum/vinyl siding, which is typical for the period and provides moderate insulation. The heating system is electric warm air, with air conditioning included, suggesting a potentially efficient HVAC setup given the home's 'very good' condition rating. Windows appear to be standard for the age, potentially benefiting from upgrades to double-glazed for better energy efficiency. No significant issues observed, though verifying the age and efficiency of the HVAC system would be advised for optimal energy performance.",
