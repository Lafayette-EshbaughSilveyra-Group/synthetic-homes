        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1987, appears to have aluminum/vinyl siding in good condition, which provides decent insulation. The windows are likely original and may benefit from upgrading to double-pane for better energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system should be evaluated for its age and efficiency; considering a more modern HVAC system could reduce energy costs. The full basement offers potential for additional insulation improvements. Overall, the property is well-maintained with an existing air conditioning system.",
