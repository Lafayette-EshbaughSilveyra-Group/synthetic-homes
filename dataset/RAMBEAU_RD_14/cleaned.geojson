The electric warm air heating system with air conditioning appears to be in good condition, typical for its age. The windows look to be original and may benefit from upgrades for better insulation. The full basement offers space for potential improvements, possibly including additional insulation. Exterior walls seem well-maintained, but energy efficiency could be enhanced with modern materials. Overall, the property is well-kept with possible opportunities for energy efficiency enhancements.",
