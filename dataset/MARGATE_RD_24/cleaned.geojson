        "inspection_note": "The home appears well-maintained with aluminum/vinyl siding, which is beneficial for insulation. The HVAC system is electric and utilizes a warm air system, which may be effective but should be checked for efficiency due to the house's age. Windows seem to be double-pane, enhancing insulation, though checking for drafts around the frames is recommended. The presence of central air conditioning suggests an upgrade for comfort. Overall, the property seems to be in good condition with potential for energy efficiency improvements.",
