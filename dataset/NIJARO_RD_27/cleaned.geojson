The heating system is warm air, but the fuel type is unknown, suggesting a review of the system is needed for potential upgrades. The windows appear original, which may lead to heat loss; energy-efficient replacements could improve insulation. The basement is full and finished, potentially providing additional living space. Overall, the exterior condition is average, and enhancements in insulation and HVAC could improve energy efficiency.",
