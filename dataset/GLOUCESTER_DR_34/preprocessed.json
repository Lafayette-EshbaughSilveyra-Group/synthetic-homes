The heating system is electric warm air, likely original, suggesting an upgrade might improve efficiency. The air conditioning is present, which is beneficial for energy efficiency. Windows appear to be double-pane but could be original, indicating potential for energy loss. The full basement may offer additional insulation if properly sealed. Overall, the home is in good condition but could benefit from modern HVAC updates and window upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
