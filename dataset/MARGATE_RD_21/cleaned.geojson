        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1985, appears to have well-maintained aluminum/vinyl siding, which provides decent insulation. The gas-powered hot water heating system is efficient, though its age is unknown and may benefit from an upgrade for optimal performance. The air conditioning system is present, suggesting improved comfort during warmer months. The windows seem to be in good condition, but upgrading to double-pane models could enhance energy efficiency. Overall, the home appears to be in good condition with potential for improved insulation and HVAC modernization.",
