        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1992, has a colonial style with aluminum/vinyl siding. The exterior appears well-maintained, which likely contributes positively to its insulation. The house uses an electric warm air heating system with air conditioning, suggesting a need for regular maintenance checks for efficiency. The windows seem to be original double-pane, which may not be as energy-efficient as modern options. Consider upgrading to newer windows for improved insulation. The full basement could benefit from additional insulation to enhance energy efficiency. Overall, the property is in good condition with potential for energy efficiency improvements through window upgrades and routine HVAC maintenance.",
