The windows seem to be double-paned, which should help in maintaining energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system is paired with air conditioning, indicating a modern HVAC setup. There are no visible signs of recent upgrades, but the overall condition suggests regular maintenance. The full basement might benefit from insulation improvements to further enhance energy efficiency.",
