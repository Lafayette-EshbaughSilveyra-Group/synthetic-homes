The HVAC system is electric with a warm air distribution, and central air conditioning is present. The windows seem original and may benefit from upgrading to improve energy efficiency. The attic is not insulated, suggesting potential heat loss, but the full basement could provide extra insulation. The house has a good energy grade, but updating HVAC and windows could enhance efficiency.",
