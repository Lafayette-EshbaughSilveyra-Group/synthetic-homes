The heating system is electric warm air, likely requiring regular maintenance given its age. The HVAC system includes air conditioning, though its efficiency may benefit from an upgrade. Windows appear to be original; replacing them with energy-efficient models could improve insulation. The full basement provides potential for additional insulation improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
