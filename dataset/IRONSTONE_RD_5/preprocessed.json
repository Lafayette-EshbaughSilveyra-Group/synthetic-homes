The bi-level structure suggests potential for efficient heating distribution, though the electric warm air system may benefit from updates to increase energy efficiency. Windows seem to be double-pane, offering decent insulation, but checking for drafts is recommended. The roof looks in good condition; however, attic insulation could not be assessed. Overall, maintaining the HVAC system and considering upgrades could improve energy efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
