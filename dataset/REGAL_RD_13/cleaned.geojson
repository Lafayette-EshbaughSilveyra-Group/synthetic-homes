The HVAC system is electric with warm air heating, possibly updated given the visible air conditioning unit. Windows seem original, suggesting potential heat loss. Insulation in attic is absent, which could affect energy efficiency. A full basement offers additional space, but inspecting for insulation and moisture is recommended. Overall, the house is in good condition with potential for energy improvements.",
