The windows are double-glazed, which should offer good thermal performance. The electric warm air heating system seems original, suggesting it might be nearing the end of its effective lifespan. The presence of central air conditioning is a plus for energy efficiency. No significant upgrades or issues were visible, but checking the insulation in the attic and walls is recommended for optimal energy savings.", "weather": "KABE"}
