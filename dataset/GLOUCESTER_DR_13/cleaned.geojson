The warm air heating system's fuel type is unknown, which could impact efficiency. The air conditioning presence is noted, but no details about its age are available. Windows appear to be original; upgrading them could improve energy efficiency. Overall, the property is in good condition, but assessing HVAC systems and window insulation for upgrades is recommended.",
