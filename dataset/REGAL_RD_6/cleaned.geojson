        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1992, appears to be in very good condition. The Colonial style house features aluminum/vinyl siding which is generally durable and low maintenance. The warm air electric heating system is complemented by central air conditioning. The windows seem to be original but in good shape, though updating to double-pane windows could improve energy efficiency. No attic insulation was noted, suggesting potential for energy savings with added insulation. The full basement could also benefit from insulation to reduce heat loss. Overall, the property is well-maintained with opportunities for modern energy upgrades.",
