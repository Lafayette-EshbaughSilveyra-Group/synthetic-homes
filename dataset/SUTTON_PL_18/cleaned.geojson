The HVAC system includes oil-fueled hot water heating, paired with air conditioning, indicative of a comprehensive climate control setup. Windows appear original, suggesting potential for energy efficiency upgrades. The full basement may contribute to heat retention, although insulation details are not visible. Overall, the property is well-kept with potential for further energy improvements.",
