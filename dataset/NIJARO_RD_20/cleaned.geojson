Central air conditioning is installed. Windows seem dated, potentially affecting insulation efficiency. There is no attic, limiting insulation options. The full basement could be improved with additional insulation to enhance energy retention. Overall, the home is in good condition but could benefit from energy efficiency upgrades such as window replacements and additional insulation.",
