The stucco exterior suggests good insulation if maintained well. The electric warm air heating system is typical, but checking its age and efficiency could be beneficial. Windows appear to be in fair condition; upgrading to double-glazed could improve energy retention. No obvious upgrades or issues with insulation were noted.", "weather": "KABE"}
