The HVAC system is electric warm air with air conditioning, indicating potential for good efficiency, though the age of the system should be checked for optimal performance. Insulation quality is not visible from the exterior, but updating may be beneficial. Windows appear to be double-glazed, which should help in retaining heat, though checking for drafts is recommended. Overall, the house appears well maintained with no obvious issues.", "weather": "KABE"}
