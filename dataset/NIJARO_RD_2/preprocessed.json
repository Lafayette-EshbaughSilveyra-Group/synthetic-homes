The HVAC system is electric with warm air heating, complemented by air conditioning, suggesting modern updates. Windows appear to be double-pane, enhancing energy efficiency. No attic insulation is noted, which may affect thermal retention. The full basement could be a source of heat loss if not properly insulated. Overall, the property seems to maintain good energy efficiency standards.", "weather": "KABE"}
