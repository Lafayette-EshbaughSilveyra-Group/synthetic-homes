        "inspection_note": "The home appears to be well-maintained with aluminum/vinyl siding that should offer decent insulation. The colonial style typically features symmetrical design, possibly indicating a consistent window layout, which could be beneficial for energy efficiency if windows are double-glazed. The electric warm air heating system is efficient, but it would be wise to confirm its age for potential upgrades. The presence of central air conditioning suggests a modern HVAC system, though checking the system's age and efficiency rating would be prudent. No visible issues with the exterior; however, adding or upgrading attic insulation could further improve energy efficiency.",
