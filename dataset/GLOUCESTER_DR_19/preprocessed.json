The HVAC system is an electric warm air system with air conditioning, suggesting moderate efficiency. Windows seem older and may benefit from upgrades to improve insulation. The full basement could be checked for any signs of moisture which might affect energy efficiency. Overall, the house has a solid structure but could use some energy efficiency upgrades, particularly in insulation and window quality.", "weather": "KABE"}
