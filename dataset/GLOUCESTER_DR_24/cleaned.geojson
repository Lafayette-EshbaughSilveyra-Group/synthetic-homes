        "inspection_note": "The colonial-style home built in 1977 features aluminum/vinyl siding, which appears in average condition. The electric warm air heating system with air conditioning suggests moderate energy efficiency, but the age may warrant inspection for potential upgrades. Windows seem original and might benefit from replacement for better insulation. The full basement provides additional space but should be checked for moisture issues. Overall, the home could improve energy efficiency with updated insulation and HVAC maintenance.",
