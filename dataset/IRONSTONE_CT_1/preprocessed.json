The electric warm air heating system is supplemented by air conditioning, though the system's age should be checked for energy efficiency. The windows appear original and may benefit from upgrades to double-pane for better insulation. The partial basement could be improved with insulation to prevent heat loss. Overall, the home appears well-maintained with average energy efficiency for its age.", "weather": "KABE"}
