The electric warm air heating system is complemented by air conditioning, suggesting an overall efficient HVAC setup for the era. Windows appear to be double-pane, which is beneficial for energy conservation. The siding looks well-maintained, contributing to the home's insulation. No visible recent upgrades, but the structure is in good condition.",
