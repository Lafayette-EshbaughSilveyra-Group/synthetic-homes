The heat pump system, utilizing electric fuel, provides efficient heating and cooling, though its age should be assessed for potential upgrades. The presence of air conditioning is notable for enhanced comfort. Windows seem standard for its era, but checking for draftiness is recommended. The full basement can be inspected for insulation quality to improve energy efficiency.",
