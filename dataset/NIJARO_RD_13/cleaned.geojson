        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1977, features aluminum/vinyl siding which appears well-maintained. The colonial style and full basement are characteristic of the period. The oil-fired hot water heating system is older, suggesting it may not be very efficient. Insulation improvements could be beneficial. Windows appear original; upgrading to double-pane could improve energy efficiency. No immediate issues are visible, but modernizing the HVAC system could enhance comfort and reduce energy costs.",
