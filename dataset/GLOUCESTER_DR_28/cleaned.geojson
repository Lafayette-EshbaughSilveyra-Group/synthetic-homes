        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1992, appears to be well-maintained with a masonry/frame exterior that likely provides good insulation. The oil-based warm air heating system might be older, so checking the efficiency and potential for upgrading to a more modern system could be beneficial. Windows appear to be double-pane, which helps with energy efficiency, though assessing for any drafts or seal issues would be wise. The presence of air conditioning suggests a comfortable summer environment. Overall, the home seems to be in good condition with no immediate energy efficiency issues visible from the exterior.",
