The heating system is electric warm air, likely older, so an efficiency upgrade could benefit. The full basement may offer additional insulation opportunities. Windows seem standard for the era, possibly double-paned; replacement with modern energy-efficient models could improve thermal performance. Overall, the property is in good condition and includes central air conditioning.",
