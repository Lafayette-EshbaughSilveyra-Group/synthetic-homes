        "inspection_note": "The home appears to have aluminum/vinyl siding which is generally good for insulation if well-maintained. The windows seem to be double-pane, which should help with energy efficiency. The heating system is electric hot water, which may be costlier than gas but effective. The HVAC system includes air conditioning, which is a plus for comfort. There are no visible signs of recent upgrades, and the original construction from 1985 suggests checking for insulation updates, especially in the attic area, which is currently noted as none.",
