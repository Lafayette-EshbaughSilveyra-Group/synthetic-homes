The electric warm air heating system is typical for homes of this age, but it may benefit from an upgrade to a more energy-efficient system. The windows seem original, likely single-pane, which could contribute to heat loss. Adding insulation in the attic and walls could improve energy efficiency. The exterior shows no major signs of upgrades; however, routine maintenance seems to be well-managed.", "weather": "KABE"}
