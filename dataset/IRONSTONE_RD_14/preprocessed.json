The electric warm air heating system appears to be standard for its time, but its efficiency could be improved with modern insulation techniques. Windows seem original, likely single-pane, which might lead to heat loss. No visible upgrades to HVAC are apparent. The full basement could benefit from insulation improvements to enhance energy efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
