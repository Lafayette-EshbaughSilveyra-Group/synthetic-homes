The electric warm air heating system is typical for this era, but checking its efficiency could be beneficial. The windows appear original and may lack modern energy efficiency, suggesting potential upgrades. Overall, the home is in good condition, but updating insulation and windows could substantially improve energy efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
