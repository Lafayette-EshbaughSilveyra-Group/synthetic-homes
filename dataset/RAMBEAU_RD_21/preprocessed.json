The electric warm air heating system is paired with air conditioning, which suggests a focus on year-round comfort. Windows appear to be double-paned, though aged, which might affect energy efficiency. The full basement provides potential for insulation enhancement. Overall, the house is in good condition, with potential improvements in window insulation and possibly updating the HVAC system to a more energy-efficient model.", "weather": "KABE"}
