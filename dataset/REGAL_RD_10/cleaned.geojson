        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1992, appears to be well-maintained with a colonial style. It features aluminum/vinyl siding, which suggests moderate insulation properties. The HVAC system is electric with warm air distribution, a common setup that might be original but appears functional. The presence of central air conditioning is a plus for energy efficiency. Windows look to be double-paned, offering decent thermal insulation. There are no visible signs of recent upgrades, but the overall condition is good, with potential for improved energy efficiency with modern insulation and sealing improvements.",
