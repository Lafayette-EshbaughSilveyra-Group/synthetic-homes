It features aluminum/vinyl siding, which suggests moderate insulation properties. The HVAC system is electric with warm air distribution, a common setup that might be original but appears functional. The presence of central air conditioning is a plus for energy efficiency. Windows look to be double-paned, offering decent thermal insulation. There are no visible signs of recent upgrades, but the overall condition is good, with potential for improved energy efficiency with modern insulation and sealing improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
