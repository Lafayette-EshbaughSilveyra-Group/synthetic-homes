The warm air electric heating system is paired with air conditioning, suggesting a focus on indoor climate control. Windows are in good condition with no visible signs of wear, indicating potential energy efficiency. The full basement might benefit from additional insulation to improve heating efficiency. Overall, the property seems to be in good condition with no major energy-related issues visible.",
