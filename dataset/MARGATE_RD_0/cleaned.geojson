The windows appear to be in fair condition, though updating to double-paned windows could improve energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system seems standard; however, assessing its age is recommended to evaluate efficiency. The full basement might benefit from additional insulation to prevent heat loss. Overall, the home is in good condition but could use some energy upgrades to enhance efficiency.",
