The HVAC system uses electric warm air heating with air conditioning, indicating a potentially moderate efficiency level. The windows look original, which may affect insulation efficiency. No visible upgrades to insulation or windows, which could improve energy efficiency. Overall, the structure maintains an average grade reflecting its age and materials.",
