The aluminum/vinyl siding is well-maintained, contributing to its energy efficiency. The electric heat pump system is relatively new, likely providing efficient heating and cooling. Windows appear to be double-pane, which should offer good insulation. The full basement could be an area to check for insulation improvements. Overall, the property seems well-equipped with modern energy-efficient features.", "weather": "KABE"}
