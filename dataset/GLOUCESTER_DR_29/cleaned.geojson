The heating system is electric warm air, and the home includes central air conditioning, suggesting adequate temperature control year-round. The windows seem to be double-pane, which aids in energy efficiency. The full basement offers potential for additional insulation improvements. Overall, the home is in good condition, with no immediate energy efficiency concerns visible from the exterior.",
