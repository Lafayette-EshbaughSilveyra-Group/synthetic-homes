The windows are older and may benefit from upgrading to improve insulation and reduce energy costs. The electric warm air heating system is standard for the area, but efficiency could be improved with modern HVAC upgrades. The full basement provides potential for additional insulation. Overall, the property is well-maintained, but energy efficiency could be enhanced with targeted upgrades to windows and HVAC systems.",
