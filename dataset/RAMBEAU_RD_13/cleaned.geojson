        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1988, appears well-maintained with a colonial style. The aluminum/vinyl siding is in average condition. The HVAC system uses electric warm air, likely indicating moderate energy efficiency. Windows appear to be double-pane, which should help with insulation, though some signs of wear suggest possible future replacement. The attic is not present, limiting additional insulation opportunities. Overall, the structure seems in good condition with potential for energy efficiency improvements in the HVAC and window areas.",
