        "inspection_note": "The house, built in 1971, appears to have aluminum/vinyl siding which is in average condition. The windows are likely original and may benefit from upgrades to improve energy efficiency. The heating system is electric warm air with air conditioning, suggesting the HVAC system might be older and possibly less efficient by modern standards. The insulation status is unclear, but given the age, an evaluation could reveal opportunities for improvement, especially in the attic and basement areas. Overall, the property seems well-maintained with potential for energy efficiency enhancements.",
