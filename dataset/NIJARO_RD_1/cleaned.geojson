The warm air electric heating system is complemented by central air conditioning, providing efficient climate control. The windows look relatively modern, suggesting replacements that may enhance insulation. The full basement offers potential for additional insulation improvements. Overall, the house's energy efficiency is supported by its construction quality and materials.",
