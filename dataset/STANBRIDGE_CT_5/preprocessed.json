The electric warm air heating system is typical for the area but should be evaluated for efficiency, considering its age. The windows seem older and may lack modern energy-efficient features, suggesting potential heat loss. The full basement could offer additional insulation if properly sealed. Overall, the house is in average condition with potential for energy efficiency upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
