        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1975, appears to have aluminum/vinyl siding which is generally good for insulation but should be checked for any gaps or damage. The electric warm air heating system is typical for the area but should be evaluated for efficiency, considering its age. The windows seem older and may lack modern energy-efficient features, suggesting potential heat loss. The full basement could offer additional insulation if properly sealed. Overall, the house is in average condition with potential for energy efficiency upgrades.",
