The windows seem to be double-paned, potentially offering good thermal efficiency. The electric heating system is warm air with air conditioning, which is typical for homes of this style and era. No visible signs of recent upgrades or issues from the exterior. The full basement could benefit from additional insulation to improve energy efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
