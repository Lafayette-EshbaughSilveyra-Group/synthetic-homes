The windows appear to be original, with some potential for drafts, suggesting a need for weather-stripping or upgrades to more energy-efficient models. The electric warm air heating system is typical for the area, but evaluating its age could help determine efficiency gains. The presence of air conditioning is a positive factor for comfort. The colonial style with a full basement offers potential for additional insulation improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
