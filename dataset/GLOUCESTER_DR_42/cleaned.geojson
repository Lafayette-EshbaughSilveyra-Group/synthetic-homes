The HVAC system is electric warm air with air conditioning, likely original and may benefit from an efficiency upgrade. Windows are double-hung, typical of the colonial style, but inspecting their seals would be advisable to ensure energy efficiency. The full basement could offer additional insulation opportunities. Overall, the property is well-maintained with potential for energy improvements.",
