The HVAC system uses electric hot water heating with air conditioning, which may benefit from an upgrade to a more energy-efficient system. The windows appear to be older, suggesting the potential for improvement in insulation and energy conservation. The full basement provides additional space, but insulation conditions should be verified. Overall, the structure maintains an average condition with room for energy efficiency upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
