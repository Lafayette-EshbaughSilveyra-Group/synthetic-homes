The windows seem original and may benefit from an upgrade to improve energy efficiency. The gas hot water heating system is typical for homes of this age, though an assessment of its current efficiency may be warranted. The presence of air conditioning is a positive aspect for comfort. No obvious signs of insulation issues were visible, but further inspection inside the attic and walls is recommended to ensure optimal energy retention.",
