        "inspection_note": "The home appears to be in good condition with aluminum/vinyl siding, which offers moderate insulation. The heating system is electric warm air, likely original given the age of the house, and features air conditioning. The windows seem to be of standard quality for the build period, potentially single-pane, suggesting possible heat loss. No visible upgrades to the exterior or insulation enhancements were noted. The full basement should be checked for insulation and potential energy efficiency improvements.",
