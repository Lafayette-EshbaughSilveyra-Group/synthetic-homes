The warm air electric heating system is supported by air conditioning, indicating a focus on temperature control. Windows appear to be standard for the home's age, with no visible upgrades. The full basement could offer additional insulation benefits. Overall, the property seems well-maintained with a focus on energy efficiency, though window upgrades could enhance thermal performance.",
