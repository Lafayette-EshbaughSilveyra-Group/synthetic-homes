The windows seem older, potentially single-pane, which could affect energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system is typical for the era, though the system's age may warrant checking for efficiency. There is no visible insulation on the exterior. The HVAC system condition is normal, but upgrading to a more efficient model could improve energy savings. The full basement might offer additional insulation opportunities. Overall, the home has potential for energy efficiency improvements with window upgrades and HVAC modernization.", "weather": "KABE"}
