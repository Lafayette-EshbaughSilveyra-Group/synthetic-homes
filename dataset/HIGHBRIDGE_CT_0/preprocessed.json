The heating system uses electric warm air, which is typical for homes of this era, but may benefit from an efficiency upgrade. The air conditioning system is present, though its age is not specified; checking its efficiency and considering an upgrade could enhance energy savings. Windows look original; replacing them with modern, energy-efficient models would further improve insulation. No visible signs of recent insulation upgrades, and the full basement offers potential for increased energy efficiency if also insulated. Overall, the property is in average condition, with some opportunities for energy efficiency improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
