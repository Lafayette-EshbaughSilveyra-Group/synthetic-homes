The windows seem to be double-paned, likely aiding in energy efficiency. The HVAC system is electric warm air, with air conditioning present, but the age of the system is not specified; it may benefit from an efficiency check. The full basement could be inspected for additional insulation improvements. Overall, the property seems well-maintained with potential for minor energy efficiency upgrades.",
