The heating system is electric warm air, likely requiring an efficiency check due to its age. Windows appear original and may benefit from upgrades to double-pane for better thermal efficiency. No visible signs of major exterior upgrades, but the insulation quality should be assessed further during a full inspection. Overall, the house is in good condition with standard energy features for its time.",
