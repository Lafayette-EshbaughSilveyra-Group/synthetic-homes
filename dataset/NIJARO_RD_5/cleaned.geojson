        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1969, appears to be a ranch-style brick construction, typical for the era. The exterior brick provides decent insulation, but additional insulation inside may be beneficial. The windows seem older and could potentially be upgraded to improve energy efficiency and reduce drafts. The HVAC system is electric with warm air distribution, and its age should be checked for efficiency. Air conditioning is present, which is a positive feature for warm weather. No significant upgrades are visible from the exterior.",
