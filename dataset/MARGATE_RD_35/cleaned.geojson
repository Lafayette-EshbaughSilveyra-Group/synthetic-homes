The electric warm air heating system is paired with air conditioning, suggesting a modern HVAC system, although its efficiency would benefit from an upgrade if original. Windows appear to be double-pane, but older frames may suggest energy loss. Overall, the home is in good condition but could benefit from insulation enhancements, especially in the attic and basement areas.",
