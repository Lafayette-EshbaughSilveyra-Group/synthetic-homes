        "inspection_note": "The home appears to be a well-maintained colonial style built in 1984. The aluminum/vinyl siding is in good condition with no visible damage. The windows look original and may benefit from upgrading to more energy-efficient models. The electric warm air heating system paired with air conditioning suggests adequate temperature control, though checking the age and efficiency of the HVAC system could be beneficial. The full basement may offer additional insulation if properly sealed. Overall, the property seems to be in good condition with potential for energy efficiency improvements in windows and HVAC.",
