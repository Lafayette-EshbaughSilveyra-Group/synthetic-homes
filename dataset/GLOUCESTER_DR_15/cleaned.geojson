        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1980, appears well-maintained with good insulation, as suggested by the colonial style and aluminum/vinyl siding. The electric warm air heating system, combined with air conditioning, likely offers efficient climate control. Windows seem to be in average condition, though upgrading to double-pane could enhance energy efficiency. The full basement may benefit from additional insulation. Overall, the property is in good condition but could explore modern energy-saving upgrades.",
