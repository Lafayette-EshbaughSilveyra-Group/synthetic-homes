The electric warm air heating system, combined with air conditioning, likely offers efficient climate control. Windows seem to be in average condition, though upgrading to double-pane could enhance energy efficiency. The full basement may benefit from additional insulation. Overall, the property is in good condition but could explore modern energy-saving upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
