The electric warm air heating system suggests moderate efficiency, typical for homes built in the 1960s. Windows seem original and may benefit from upgrades to improve energy efficiency. The full basement could offer additional insulation, but checking for any potential moisture issues is advisable. Overall, the property's energy efficiency is average, with room for improvements in window and HVAC updates.",
