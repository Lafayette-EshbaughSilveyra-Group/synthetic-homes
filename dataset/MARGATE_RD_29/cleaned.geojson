The heating system is an electric heat pump, indicating efficient heating and cooling, paired with air conditioning. Windows look relatively new and likely double-glazed, enhancing insulation. The full basement could benefit from additional insulation for energy savings. Overall, the house seems to have good energy efficiency, though checking the HVAC system's age is advisable for potential upgrades.",
