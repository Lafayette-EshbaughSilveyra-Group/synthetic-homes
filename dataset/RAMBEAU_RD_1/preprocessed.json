The windows look reasonably updated, likely providing good insulation, though a thorough check would be needed to confirm any drafts. The electric warm air heating system paired with air conditioning suggests a focus on year-round comfort, but the energy efficiency may vary depending on the system's age and maintenance. The full basement is a potential area for heat loss, necessitating proper insulation. Overall, the home's style and structure indicate it is well-suited for modern energy efficiency improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
