It features an electric warm air heating system with air conditioning, likely requiring an update for improved efficiency. The windows seem original and may benefit from upgrading to double-pane for better insulation. The full basement could be checked for moisture issues, common in older homes. Overall, the property appears well-maintained with average energy efficiency for its age.",
