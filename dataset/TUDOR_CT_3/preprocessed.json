The electric warm air heating system is supported by central air conditioning, typical for homes of this style and age. Windows appear original; upgrading to double-pane could improve energy efficiency. The full basement is likely unfinished, offering potential for additional insulation improvements. Overall, the property is in good condition, with typical energy efficiency for its era but room for upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
