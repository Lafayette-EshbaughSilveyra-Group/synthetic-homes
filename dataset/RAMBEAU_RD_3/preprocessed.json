The warm air electric heating system and air conditioning appear to be in good condition, although the age may warrant efficiency checks. Windows are double-pane, helping with insulation, but may benefit from sealing inspections. No visible signs of recent upgrades to the HVAC or insulation, suggesting standard efficiency for the home's age. The full basement could be checked for insulation improvements to enhance energy efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
