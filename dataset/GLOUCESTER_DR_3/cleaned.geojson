        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1988, appears well-maintained with aluminum/vinyl siding. The HVAC system is electric with warm air heating, indicating it may be due for an upgrade considering its age. Windows seem to be double-pane, providing decent insulation, though checking for drafts is advisable. No visible signs of recent exterior upgrades, but the property is in good condition overall. Consider assessing attic insulation as there is none noted, which could improve energy efficiency.",
