The electric warm air heating system is complemented by air conditioning. Given its age, the HVAC system may require assessment for efficiency or updates. Windows appear original, possibly limiting energy efficiency. Consider checking for any drafts or necessary upgrades. The full basement suggests potential for additional insulation improvements.",
