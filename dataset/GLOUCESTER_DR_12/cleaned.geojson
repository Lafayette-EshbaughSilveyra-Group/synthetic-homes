The warm air heating system is electric and includes air conditioning, suggesting decent energy efficiency for its age. The windows appear to be original, and upgrading to modern, double-glazed options could improve efficiency. There is no attic for additional insulation, but the full basement might offer some insulation from below. Overall, the home is in good condition, though window and insulation upgrades are recommended for improved energy efficiency.",
