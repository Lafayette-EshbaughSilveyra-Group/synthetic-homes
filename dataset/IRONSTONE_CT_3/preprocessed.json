The HVAC system is electric with warm air heating, typical for homes of this era. Insulation may be less than modern standards, and checking attic and wall insulation could be beneficial. Windows appear to be older, possibly original, suggesting they may not be energy-efficient; upgrading to double-glazed units could improve efficiency. The full basement is likely uninsulated, which might contribute to heat loss. Overall, maintaining the HVAC system and upgrading insulation and windows could enhance energy efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
