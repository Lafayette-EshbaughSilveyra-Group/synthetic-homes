        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1980, features aluminum/vinyl siding which appears in average condition for its age. The colonial style suggests traditional construction with likely original insulation levels. The HVAC system is electric warm air with air conditioning, but the age of the system should be verified for efficiency. Windows appear to be double-paned, offering moderate insulation. No visible recent upgrades, but overall the structure seems well-maintained.",
