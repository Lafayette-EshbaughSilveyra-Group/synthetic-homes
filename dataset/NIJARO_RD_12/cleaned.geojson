        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1977, features aluminum/vinyl siding which appears to be in average condition. The electric warm air heating system is typical for its age but may benefit from an efficiency upgrade. Windows are double-pane, suggesting moderate insulation, though checking for drafts is recommended. The attic is not present, limiting potential for added insulation. Overall, the property seems well-maintained but could improve energy efficiency with modern HVAC and additional insulation.",
