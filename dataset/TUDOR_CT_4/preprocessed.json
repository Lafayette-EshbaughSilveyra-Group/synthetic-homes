The colonial style suggests a traditional insulation setup, likely with fiberglass batts. The gas-powered hot water heating system is typical for homes of this era, and central air conditioning indicates a focus on summer comfort. Windows appear to be double-pane, offering decent insulation, though checking for drafts would be advisable. The full basement might benefit from additional insulation to improve energy efficiency. Overall, the property is in good condition with potential for energy efficiency upgrades in insulation and window sealing.", "weather": "KABE"}
