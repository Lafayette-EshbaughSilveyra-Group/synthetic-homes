The HVAC system is electric with warm air distribution, and the presence of air conditioning suggests a relatively modern system. Windows appear to be double-paned, which should provide good insulation. The roof looks to be in fair condition, likely replaced in the last decade. No visible energy efficiency upgrades such as solar panels or advanced insulation materials were noted. Overall, the home seems well-maintained with potential for further efficiency improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
