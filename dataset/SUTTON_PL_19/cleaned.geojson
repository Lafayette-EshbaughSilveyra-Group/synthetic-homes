The warm air heating system utilizes electric fuel and includes air conditioning, suggesting some updates to maintain energy efficiency. The windows appear original and may benefit from replacement to improve insulation. The full basement offers potential for added insulation and energy efficiency improvements. Overall, the property is well-maintained with good potential for further energy upgrades.",
