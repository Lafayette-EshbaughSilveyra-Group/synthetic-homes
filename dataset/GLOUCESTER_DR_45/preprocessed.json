The aluminum/vinyl siding appears well-kept, offering decent insulation. Windows seem to be double-glazed, providing adequate energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system, combined with air conditioning, suggests moderate energy consumption. No recent upgrades are visible, but the HVAC system could benefit from an efficiency evaluation due to its age. The full basement is a potential area for energy loss if not properly insulated.", "weather": "KABE"}
