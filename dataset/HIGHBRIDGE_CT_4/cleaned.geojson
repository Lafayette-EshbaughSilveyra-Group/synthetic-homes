The heating system is electric warm air, likely original, suggesting it may benefit from a more modern, energy-efficient upgrade. Windows appear to be standard for the era, with potential for improved insulation. No visible signs of recent energy-efficient upgrades. The full basement might offer opportunities for additional insulation improvements. Overall, the property is in average condition with potential for energy efficiency enhancements.",
