The HVAC system is electric with warm air heating, likely requiring an efficiency check given the home's age. Windows seem to be in average condition, and upgrading to double-glazed options could improve energy efficiency. The full basement might contribute to heat loss if not properly insulated. Overall, the property looks to be in good condition, but energy efficiency improvements could be beneficial.",
