The electric heating system is a warm air type, supplemented by air conditioning. The windows seem original and could benefit from an upgrade to improve energy efficiency. No visible insulation issues, but updating the HVAC system and adding modern insulation could enhance overall energy performance. The full basement and two stories suggest ample space, though energy loss might occur if not properly insulated.", "weather": "KABE"}
