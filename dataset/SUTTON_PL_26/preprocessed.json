The gas-fueled hot water heating system appears to be in average condition, likely providing efficient heat distribution. The presence of central air conditioning is a positive for energy efficiency. Windows seem original and may benefit from upgrades to double-glazed units to reduce heat loss. The roof and siding appear intact, suggesting good insulation, but further assessment is advisable to confirm. Overall, the property is in good condition but could improve energy efficiency with window and potential HVAC upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
