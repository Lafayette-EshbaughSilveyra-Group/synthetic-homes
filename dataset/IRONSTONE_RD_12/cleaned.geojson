        "inspection_note": "The home appears well-maintained with aluminum/vinyl siding, which provides decent insulation. The windows seem to be older, potentially single-pane, which might affect energy efficiency. The electric warm air heating system is consistent with the property's age. The presence of air conditioning suggests some modernization. No visible insulation issues from the exterior, but evaluating the attic (if present) would be beneficial. Overall, the house might benefit from window upgrades to improve thermal performance.",
