The HVAC system is a warm air electric type with air conditioning, likely original, indicating it may be due for an upgrade for better energy efficiency. The windows seem to be double-pane, which helps with insulation, but an inspection of seals is recommended. No recent upgrades were noted, so checking attic and wall insulation could be beneficial. The full basement may offer potential for additional insulation improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
