        "inspection_note": "The colonial-style home appears well-maintained with aluminum/vinyl siding which should offer decent insulation. The electric warm air heating system, installed in 1989, may benefit from an efficiency upgrade. Central air conditioning is present, which is ideal for comfort. Windows look original, likely single-pane, suggesting potential for energy loss, so upgrading to double-pane could improve efficiency. The full basement offers additional space but should be checked for insulation to avoid heat loss.",
