The electric warm air heating system, installed in 1989, may benefit from an efficiency upgrade. Central air conditioning is present, which is ideal for comfort. Windows look original, likely single-pane, suggesting potential for energy loss, so upgrading to double-pane could improve efficiency. The full basement offers additional space but should be checked for insulation to avoid heat loss.", "weather": "KABE"}
