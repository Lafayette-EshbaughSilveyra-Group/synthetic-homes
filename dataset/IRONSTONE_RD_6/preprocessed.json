The HVAC system is electric warm air with air conditioning, which suggests moderate energy efficiency typical for its age. Windows seem original and may benefit from an upgrade to improve insulation and reduce energy loss. The full basement provides potential for additional insulation to enhance energy efficiency. Overall, the property is well-maintained but could benefit from modern energy-efficient upgrades.", "weather": "KABE"}
