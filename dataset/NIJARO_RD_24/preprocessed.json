The warm air heating system is electric and likely original, suggesting it may be less efficient compared to modern systems. The windows appear to be older and could benefit from upgrading to double-pane for improved insulation. There is no attic, limiting additional insulation opportunities. The full basement could be checked for moisture issues, but its finished area is a positive feature for thermal retention. Overall, while the house is well-maintained, investing in window upgrades and exploring HVAC improvements could enhance energy efficiency.", "weather": "KABE"}
