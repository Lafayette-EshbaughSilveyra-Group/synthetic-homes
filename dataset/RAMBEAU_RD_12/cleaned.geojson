        "inspection_note": "The home appears well-maintained with a classic colonial style. The aluminum/vinyl siding is in average condition, providing moderate insulation. The windows are likely original, with potential for energy efficiency upgrades. The electric warm air heating and air conditioning system is functional, though assessing the age of the HVAC system would be beneficial for energy efficiency. The full basement offers additional space, but insulation quality should be checked to ensure efficiency. Overall, the home is in good condition with opportunities for energy improvements, particularly in window and insulation upgrades.",
