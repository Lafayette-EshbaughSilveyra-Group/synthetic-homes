        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1980, is a well-maintained colonial style with aluminum/vinyl siding, suggesting moderate insulation. The windows appear to be older and may benefit from upgrading to more energy-efficient models. The electric warm air heating system is in place and, paired with central air conditioning, should provide decent climate control, though an HVAC update might improve efficiency. The full basement adds potential for additional insulation improvements. Overall, the property maintains a good energy efficiency grade.",
