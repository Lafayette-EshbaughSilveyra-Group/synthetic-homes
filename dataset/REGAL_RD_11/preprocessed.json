The oil-based electric heating system is functional, but checking its efficiency might be beneficial given its age. The central air conditioning is a plus for energy efficiency. Windows seem to be double-paned, which should help with insulation, though verifying their sealing is recommended. There appear to be no major upgrades visible from the exterior that would impact energy efficiency significantly.", "weather": "KABE"}
