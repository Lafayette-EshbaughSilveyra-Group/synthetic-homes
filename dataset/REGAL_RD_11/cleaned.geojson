        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1993, appears to have a well-maintained aluminum/vinyl siding exterior. The oil-based electric heating system is functional, but checking its efficiency might be beneficial given its age. The central air conditioning is a plus for energy efficiency. Windows seem to be double-paned, which should help with insulation, though verifying their sealing is recommended. There appear to be no major upgrades visible from the exterior that would impact energy efficiency significantly.",
