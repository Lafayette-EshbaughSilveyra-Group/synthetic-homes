The windows seem to be original with standard double-pane glass, offering moderate insulation. The electric warm air heating system is likely dated, potentially impacting energy efficiency. Central air conditioning is present, which is beneficial for cooling. Overall, the property is well-maintained with no immediate energy efficiency upgrades visible, though window and HVAC updates could improve performance.",
