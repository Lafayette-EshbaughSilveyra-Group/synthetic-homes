        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1987, features aluminum/vinyl siding which appears in good condition for its age. The windows look to be original, suggesting they may benefit from an upgrade to improve energy efficiency. The heating system is electric warm air, likely nearing the end of its typical lifespan, which could impact efficiency. The presence of air conditioning is a positive feature. Insulation quality couldn't be assessed visually, but upgrading it could enhance energy savings. Overall, the house offers a solid structure but would benefit from modern energy-efficient improvements.",
