        "inspection_note": "The home appears to be well-maintained with a colonial style. The aluminum/vinyl siding is in good condition, suggesting minimal heat loss. Windows seem to be double-paned, which should improve insulation. The electric warm air heating system likely offers consistent heating but could be more efficient if upgraded to a modern heat pump system. The presence of central air conditioning indicates good summer comfort. No obvious insulation issues, but an energy audit could identify potential improvements.",
