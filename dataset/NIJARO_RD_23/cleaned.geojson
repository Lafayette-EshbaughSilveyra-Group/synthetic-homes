        "inspection_note": "The home, built in 1977, shows typical energy efficiency for its age. The aluminum/vinyl siding appears well-maintained, suggesting moderate insulation effectiveness. Windows seem original and may benefit from upgrades to double-pane for improved energy retention. The heating system uses warm air but lacks a specified fuel type, indicating potential for energy savings with a modern upgrade. The HVAC system is rated as normal, suggesting average performance. Consider inspecting the attic and basement for additional insulation opportunities.",
