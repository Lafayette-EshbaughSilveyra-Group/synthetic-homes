The aluminum/vinyl siding appears well-maintained, suggesting moderate insulation effectiveness. Windows seem original and may benefit from upgrades to double-pane for improved energy retention. The heating system uses warm air but lacks a specified fuel type, indicating potential for energy savings with a modern upgrade. The HVAC system is rated as normal, suggesting average performance. Consider inspecting the attic and basement for additional insulation opportunities.", "weather": "KABE"}
