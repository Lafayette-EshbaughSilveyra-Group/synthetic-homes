The windows look original and might benefit from upgrades to reduce heat loss. The house features a warm air electric heating system with air conditioning, likely requiring an efficiency assessment due to its age. Insulation seems adequate, but an attic inspection is recommended for confirmation. The full basement could be further evaluated for insulation and moisture control. Overall, the property is well-maintained with potential for energy efficiency improvements.", "weather": "KABE"}
