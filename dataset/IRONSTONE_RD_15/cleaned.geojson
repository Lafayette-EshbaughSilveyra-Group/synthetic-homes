The exterior brick is in good condition but may benefit from repointing in certain areas to improve insulation. The windows are original and could be upgraded to double-pane models for better energy efficiency. The electric heating system is a warm air type, typical for the age, but could be assessed for efficiency improvements or a potential upgrade to a heat pump system. Overall, the home is in average condition with no major visible upgrades or issues.",
