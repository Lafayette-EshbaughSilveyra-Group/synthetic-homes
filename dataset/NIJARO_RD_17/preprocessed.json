The windows, typical of the era, may benefit from upgrading to energy-efficient models to improve insulation. The HVAC system relies on electric warm air heating with air conditioning, suggesting moderate energy efficiency; checking the system's age could identify potential savings from an upgrade. The full basement provides additional insulation but should be checked for any moisture issues. Overall, the property is well-maintained but could benefit from energy upgrades typical for homes of this age.", "weather": "KABE"}
