## Notes

- used the heuristic labeler, with weighing of 0.8 := E+; 0.2 := text weights

## Observation

At a high level, I am very pleased with these results. In exp. 3, good/poor matches poor/good for some variables. Perhaps the E+ labels are a bit too small, but that can be mathematically inflated.
