## Notes

- used GPT as the E+ labeler
- applied the weights E+ := .7, text := .3

## Observations

I observed similar results to those from the heuristic labeler. However, they were a bit less "potent" than the heuristic labeler.

## Reflection

As it stands, I think we should keep using the heuristic method.
