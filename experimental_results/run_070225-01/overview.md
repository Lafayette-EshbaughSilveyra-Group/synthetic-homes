# Experimental Run | July 2, 2025 | ID `070225-01`

## Overview
We observed strong promise from experiment 1, textual variations. However, experiments 2 and 3 are less than promising. This leads us to conclude that the pipeline is biased toward the text data.

## Changes
To account for this, we have updated the prompt to instruct the model weigh the sources more equally, adding

```markdown
**You must consider BOTH the simulation data and the inspection report equally when making your decision.** Base your judgment on **both sources of information**, weighing quantitative simulation data and qualitative narrative data with equal importance.
```

## Follow-up Run
The experimental results including these changes are filed under ID `070225-02`.
